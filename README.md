# Minesweeper-SFML

Hello! I am Jake West, a sophomore computer engineering student at the University of Florida. Welcome to my rendition of Minesweeper using SFML!

- The game first consists of a welcome window, in which you may type up to 10 characters, not use special characters, and use the arrow keys to modify individual charcaters.
- Then, you are brought to a difficulty screen in which you may choose the preset easy, medium, and hard options, with varying number of tiles and bombs, or change the board_config.cfg file, which has the order of number of columns, rows, and mines from top down, to have your own personal values, then click the "From file" option.
- After that, you can play the game! You may check the leaderboard of past players at any time, reset the board, use the debug button to see where the mines are, pause and unpause, and see your name added to the leaderboard at the end if you win with a record time!


Thank you for viewing and enjoying.
